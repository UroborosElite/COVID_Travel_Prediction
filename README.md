## Topic:
Is the US on track to meet President Biden's projected vaccine rollout to all adults in the US by end of May 2021? If not, when cant this me estimated? What objectives would the US need to meet in order to improve its vaccine rollout when compared to Israel who is considered, by the global community, to have effected a successful vaccine rollout?


## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupiter Notebook
* HTML

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean and explore the data.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, integrating Flask as a means to display the data.

## Machine Learning Model
SciKitLearn is the ML library we will be using to create a classifier. We will be modeling our data using a linear regression model, using the last 30 days of USA and Israel vaccination data.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js and plotly for a functioning dashboard. It will be hosted on S3.
